Hi! Call me Elle :)
I'm an aspiring video game programmer.
I mainly work in Unity, using C/C+.
I'm proficient in Python, JavaScript, Java and learning HTML/CSS.
Fun fact! I'm also a digital artist, so I create my own assets.
Sprites, Backgrounds, UI, Animations...

Anyways have a good day!!!


NOTES:
- working on first video game
